Download EVE Radio Sessions:

Gets all the rewind shows on http://eve-radio.com/ and puts them in a list.

Download all/selected shows to a library of your choosing.
Can also get a random proxy if the firewall blocks EVE Radio.

Can open Filezilla (if installed) and open the location of the shows in the left tab.

For questions, please contact me :)
